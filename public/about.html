<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is James. I am 26 years old and I am from Newcastle. I love sports, specifically football - I support Chelsea FC.
   In my free time I try to stay fit and healthy, and therefore, try to go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week. I also try to go on walks often
   either with my friends or girlfriend. I have numerous tattoos - nearly both arms are filled, and 1 of my legs is half finished too.
   I love space and astronomy and have done since I was young - I have always been deeply fascinated with what is out there...
</p>

<p>I am currently working in the financial services sector, specifically within AML.
  I have numerous years experience in this sector and I really enjoy it. It is a very interesting industry and I work on unique cases.
</p>

<p>I do not have any coding experience or knowledge, however, I am currently partaking in a Udemy Web Development Course which
  is narrated by Angela Yu - it has been incredibly insightful and fun thus far. I look forward to seeing how
  my coding skills develop along the way.
